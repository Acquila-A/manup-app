# ManUp-App

The main reason for the app and database server is so we can have overall statistics on an international, national, and local level, and so we can see where improvements are needed to be made and implemented. The app and database will also keep our program on a uniformity level so each program is the same. 

The app’s to be built in this project is an app for the facilitators and an app for the clients.  Both apps will be built into one and the app the person enters is based on the tag that the email/username has been given. The future idea is for the upgraded website for the church will have access to the app info inside the members area and can be used fully inside that admin website as well as the app.  But for now, we will just be building the app for manup & legacy 2.0, 10-week program.

APOINTMENT OF THE ACCESS TAGS

      c.	{FACILITATORS TAG – CO-FACILITATOR}.
